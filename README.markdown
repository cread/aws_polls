aws_polls
=====

*aws_polls* is a simple web application to when teaching people about web stuff. It's called *aws_polls* because I use it when teaching people about Amazon Web Services.

This app is heavily based on the excellent [Django Tutorial](http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/intro/tutorial01/).
